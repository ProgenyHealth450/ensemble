## Framework Profiles

### Ensemble (Sunstone Partners, v5.0.0)

**Philosophy:** Full-lifecycle orchestration platform with specialized agent mesh and persistent task state.

Ensemble is a Claude Code plugin ecosystem organized into 4 tiers across 24 npm packages. It provides 28 specialized agents orchestrated through YAML-defined workflow commands. The primary pipeline: `create-prd` → `refine-prd` → `create-trd` → `refine-trd` → `implement-trd-beads`, driven by persistent beads (`br`/`bv`) task management with cross-session resumability and dependency-aware triage.

Key architectural elements:
- **Plugin tiers:** Core → Workflow → Framework Skills → Test Frameworks
- **Agent mesh:** 28 specialized agents; delegation via Task() tool
- **Task persistence:** beads SQLite + JSONL with dependency graphs and PageRank
- **Runtimes:** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, OMP
- **Enforcement:** Soft-gate constitution (pauses, allows override)
- **Scope:** Full lifecycle PRD → TRD → implement

### BMAD (BMAD Code, v6.8.0)

**Philosophy:** Scale-adaptive, agile-first AI-driven development that right-sizes planning to work complexity.

BMAD is an npm-installable Node.js CLI providing specialized agents organized by agile roles (Analyst, Product Manager, Architect, Developer, Tester). The framework uses markdown agents and YAML workflows to orchestrate planning and delivery. Scale-adaptive intelligence automatically adjusts depth: Quick Flow for bug fixes and small features (straight to spec/build); fuller planning for complex initiatives. Expansion packs extend beyond software into any domain.

Key architectural elements:
- **Agent roles:** Analyst, Product Manager, Architect, Product Owner, Developer, Scrum Master, Tester
- **Scale-adaptive workflows:** Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories → Code (depth varies)
- **Quick Flow:** Bypass planning for trivial changes
- **Documentation-first:** All decisions become version-controlled artifacts
- **Runtimes:** Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex CLI
- **Expansion packs:** Domain specialization (Game Dev, Creative, Testing, etc.)
- **Web bundles:** Planning via Gemini Gems and ChatGPT Custom GPTs

### Spec-Kit (GitHub, github.com/github/spec-kit)

**Philosophy:** Extensible, intent-driven harness via Spec-Driven Development with constitutional governance.

Spec-Kit is a Python CLI providing 30+ agent support and core SDD process: Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement. Each phase produces Markdown artifacts. No plugin ecosystem; framework-agnostic by design. Constitutional governance via immutable Nine Articles enforced as hard phase gates.

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Ensemble | BMAD | Spec-Kit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration Model** | YAML workflow commands + agent mesh + Foreman dispatch | YAML workflows + markdown agents; scale-adaptive | State machine orchestrator + PM/developer roles |
| **Core Pipeline** | PRD → TRD → implement | Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories → Code | Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement |
| **Planning Depth** | Fixed (PRD + TRD phases) | Adaptive (Quick Flow or full) | Fixed (5 phases) |
| **Requirement IDs** | REQ-NNN, AC-NNN-M, TRD-NNN | Document-based (artifact references) | Implicit (document position) |
| **Bidirectional Traceability** | ID-based chains with closure tokens | Story→Architecture→Code mapping | Document position linking |
| **Persistent Task State** | beads (SQLite + JSONL, cross-session) | Workflow artifacts only (session ephemeral) | Markdown checkboxes (session ephemeral) |
| **Multi-Agent Execution** | 28 agents; role-based state machine | Multiple agents; agile role-based orchestration | PM + developer agent pair |
| **Parallel Execution** | `bv --robot-plan` concurrent dispatch | Sequential workflow phases | Sequential task execution |
| **Cross-Session Resumability** | Full — beads survive session end | No — workflow artifacts restart | No — state lost |
| **Team Mode** | Auto-detects complexity; generates config | Built-in agile team roles | Single agent guidance |
| **Design/Architecture Artifact** | Embedded in TRD | Standalone `architecture.md` | Standalone `PLAN.md` |
| **Quick/Lightweight Path** | None — all work follows PRD→TRD pipeline | Quick Flow (spec straight to build) | Spec-only path (skip plan if clear) |
| **Constitution / Principles** | `docs/standards/constitution.md` via `/init-project`; soft-gated | Implicit in agent personas; not formalized | `memory/constitution.md` Nine Articles; hard-gated |
| **Expansion/Specialization** | Framework-specific plugins only | Expansion packs (domain-agnostic) | Community catalog (third-party) |
| **Multi-Runtime Support** | Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, OMP (5) | Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI (3) | 30+ agents (broadest) |
| **Setup Complexity** | High (Node.js, br/bv binaries, Claude Code) | Medium (Node.js CLI, AI agent) | Low (Python uv, any agent) |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep (24 packages, YAML, beads) | Medium (agile roles, workflows, markdown) | Low (Python, Markdown) |
| **Maintenance Overhead** | High (npm packages, schema CI) | Medium (expansion packs, npm) | Low (~30 files) |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Planning Depth & Scope Adaptivity

**Ensemble** enforces a fixed pipeline: PRD → TRD → implement. Every feature receives the same depth of planning regardless of complexity. This ensures consistency but may add overhead for trivial changes.

**BMAD** implements scale-adaptive intelligence. Quick Flow skips planning for well-defined bug fixes or small features, jumping straight to spec and build. Larger initiatives receive fuller planning (Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories). The framework sizes itself to the work.

**Spec-Kit** offers a middle ground: five fixed phases but allows skipping plan phase if the spec is sufficiently detailed. Less adaptive than BMAD, less prescriptive than Ensemble.

**Assessment:** For organizations with mixed-complexity workloads (both trivial and complex changes), BMAD's scale-adaptivity is a significant advantage. Ensemble's fixed depth is better for consistency-heavy environments. Spec-Kit requires manual judgment to skip phases.

### 2. Agent Organization & Specialization

**Ensemble** provides 28 specialized agents with deep expertise per domain (backend-developer, frontend-developer, code-reviewer, etc.). Agents are Claude Code plugins with framework-specific skills (React, NestJS, Rails).

**BMAD** provides agents organized by agile roles (Analyst, Product Manager, Architect, Developer, Tester, Scrum Master). Role-based rather than domain-specific; expansion packs add domain expertise (Game Dev, Creative, Testing).

**Spec-Kit** uses a simpler model: PM agent + developer agent. No specialized domain agents.

**Assessment:** Ensemble offers the deepest specialization for specific stacks. BMAD's role-based model is more intuitive for agile teams. Spec-Kit's simplicity reduces cognitive overhead for small teams.

### 3. Documentation-First vs. Code-First

**Ensemble** prioritizes specs (PRD/TRD) but keeps implementation at the center. Agents orchestrate code delivery; specs guide, not constrain.

**BMAD** is explicitly documentation-first: every decision becomes a version-controlled artifact (Brief, PRD, Architecture, Stories, Code). Artifacts drive decisions; code follows.

**Spec-Kit** is spec-driven: SPEC.md → PLAN.md → TASKS.md → code. Documentation is the single source of truth.

**Assessment:** For compliance-heavy or audit-intensive environments, documentation-first (BMAD, Spec-Kit) is superior. For rapid iteration, code-first (Ensemble) may be faster.

### 4. Task Persistence & Cross-Session Workflow

**Ensemble** shines here: beads persistence layer survives session interruptions. Teams can resume work across time zones or after crashes with full audit trail.

**BMAD** and **Spec-Kit** both rely on session ephemeral state. Workflow artifacts are version-controlled but not actively managed across sessions.

**Assessment:** Ensemble is far superior for long-running projects, asynchronous teams, or complex implementations. BMAD and Spec-Kit are acceptable for single-session or short feature work.

### 5. Constitutional Governance

**Ensemble** provides `/init-project` generating `docs/standards/constitution.md` with guardrails and quality gates. Enforcement is soft-gated: pauses implementation, requires decision, allows override.

**BMAD** embeds governance in agent personas (Analyst ensures scope, Architect ensures contracts). Governance is implicit, not formalized as a document.

**Spec-Kit** enforces Nine Articles as immutable hard-phase-gates that can block spec/plan generation.

**Assessment:** Spec-Kit is most rigorous. Ensemble's soft gates balance flexibility with guardrails. BMAD's persona-based governance is lightweight but less enforceable.

### 6. Lightweight vs. Comprehensive Tooling

**Ensemble** is comprehensive: includes git-town, conventional commits, release orchestration, CI/CD templates, E2E testing, security scanning, MCP integration.

**BMAD** is lean core + modular expansion packs. Core focuses on planning/delivery; specializations (Game Dev, Creative, Testing) via opt-in packs.

**Spec-Kit** is spec-focused only; infrastructure/testing/release are user's responsibility.

**Assessment:** Ensemble provides the most complete lifecycle. BMAD's modular approach scales better. Spec-Kit's narrowness makes it lightweight.
