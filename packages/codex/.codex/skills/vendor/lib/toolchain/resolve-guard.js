/**
 * `UNKNOWN_ADAPTER` resolver guard (TRD-2026-8d825f54 TRD-046).
 *
 * `resolveCategory()` (`./config.js`) returns `{value, source}` with no check that `value` is
 * an adapter id that actually ships anywhere (repo-local, user, or installed) for the category
 * it was resolved for: a project or user `.ensemble/toolchain.yaml`/`toolchain.yaml` naming a
 * typo'd or never-shipped adapter id (for example `{iac: pulumi}` when only `terraform` ships)
 * silently "resolves" to that bogus id, and the mistake only surfaces later, and only for
 * entry points that happen to call `loadAdapter` afterward (`run`, `confirm-status`,
 * `confirm-record`, `preflight`), as a generic `NOT_INSTALLED` naming every location searched --
 * never for `resolve`/`explain`, which never call `loadAdapter` at all and so report the bogus
 * selection as if it were perfectly valid.
 *
 * `assertKnownAdapter(category, resolved, ctx)` closes that gap: it throws an `Error` with
 * `.code === 'UNKNOWN_ADAPTER'`, naming `category`, the offending `resolved.value`, and every
 * real adapter id shipped for `category` (via `./adapters.js#discoverAdapters`, reading each
 * candidate's own `adapter.yaml` `categories` field -- `discoverAdapters` itself never
 * partitions its results by category), when BOTH of these hold:
 *   - `resolved.source` is `'project'` or `'user'` -- an EXPLICIT config selection. `'default'`
 *     (the shipped `toolchain.default.yaml`), `'detection'` (`./detect.js`, which only ever
 *     returns a candidate `discoverAdapters` itself found) and `'env-compat'` (the legacy
 *     `ENSEMBLE_HOST`/`ENSEMBLE_WORKFLOW`-style inputs, host/workflow only) can never name an
 *     unshipped id by construction, so this guard never second-guesses any of those three tiers.
 *   - `category` is not `tracker` or `host`. Both already support several legitimately shipped
 *     adapters (`beads`/`jira`/`azure-boards` for `tracker`; `github`/`azure-devops` for
 *     `host`) and are intentionally out of this bead's scope (TRD-046 targets the single-
 *     default-adapter categories TRD-042/043/044 just shipped); re-validating them here risks
 *     regressing an already-working, previously-untouched resolution path for no AC this bead
 *     names. `work-graph` needs no explicit exclusion here: every call site below resolves it
 *     through `./work-graph-resolve.js#resolveWorkGraphAdapter`, a completely separate code
 *     path (TRD-027/I7's `auto` fallback expansion) that never calls `resolveCategory`/this
 *     guard at all.
 *
 * This lives in its own file rather than inside `./config.js` (which already owns
 * `resolveCategory`'s precedence chain) because `./config.js` cannot `require('./adapters')`
 * without creating a circular require: `./adapters.js` already does
 * `require('./config')` at its own top level (for `loadToolchainConfigFile`, used by its
 * repo-local trust check), and both modules assign a *new* `module.exports` object at the end
 * of the file rather than mutating a pre-existing one, so whichever of the two loads second
 * would capture the other's exports mid-initialization (before that final assignment runs) --
 * silently `undefined` destructured bindings, not a loud failure. A new, leaf file that only
 * `require('./adapters')` (and is required by nothing `./adapters.js` or `./config.js`
 * themselves load) sidesteps that entirely.
 *
 * `preflight.js#runPreflight`'s own `resolveCategory` call sites are intentionally NOT wired to
 * this guard in this bead: `runPreflight` already calls `loadAdapter` immediately after
 * `resolveCategory` for every non-`work-graph` category, which already throws `NOT_INSTALLED`
 * (mapped to `HEALTH_FAILED` there) for exactly this same "resolved to a never-shipped id"
 * case -- preflight already fails closed for it today, just under a different, pre-existing
 * code name that no AC this bead names asks to change.
