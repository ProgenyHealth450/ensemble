/**
 * TRD-011: mode-aware run-config resolution for
 * /ensemble:author-playwright-tests.
 *
 * Pure mapping/config-resolution logic only — this module does not launch
 * Playwright itself (that's runtime behavior when the real session runs
 * against a real target app). It answers one question: given the session's
 * mode (TRD-007's 'headed'|'headless' choice, threaded through
 * delegation-contract.js's `mode` field) and whatever auth state is
 * available, what auth strategy and launch config should the test run use?
 *
 * TRD-037 (found live-dogfooding this feature — the same thread as an
 * earlier "auth state file not found" blocker resurfacing, because this
 * module's documented model still didn't reflect it): mode and auth
 * strategy are ORTHOGONAL, not the same choice wearing two names. This
 * module originally modeled headed as "always a live interactive login, no
 * stored credentials" and headless as "always a stored storage-state file"
 * — but that conflates two independent concerns. Many real Playwright
 * harnesses behind SSO (Entra ID and otherwise) capture ONE stored auth
 * state once, out of band, and reuse it for EVERY run afterward, headed or
 * headless alike — headed/headless there only toggles whether a human is
 * watching the browser, never how authentication happens. So:
 *   - If a stored auth-state path is available, it is used regardless of
 *     mode — mode only ever controls Playwright's `headless` launch option.
 *   - A live interactive login is the FALLBACK, only available when a human
 *     is actually present to perform it (mode === 'headed') and no stored
 *     state was given.
 *   - Headless with no stored state remains impossible — there is no human
 *     present to log in live — reported as a clear error, not a silent
 *     fallback (AC-013-4, TRD-011 Implementation AC unchanged).
 * That stored auth-state file lives in the consuming project, not this
 * repo — this module only ever references its path, never reads/creates it.
 *
 * TRD-036 (found live-dogfooding this feature): a stored storage-state file
 * is scoped to the origin it was captured against. A consuming repo with
 * more than one QA/staging deploy target (per-branch or per-developer slots
 * are a common pattern, not specific to any one project) can resolve a
 * DIFFERENT environment URL from one session to the next — reusing one
 * static authStatePath across every environment produces a session that
 * silently doesn't apply (an auth redirect loop), a failure that looks like
 * a real regression exactly the same way an environment-mismatch test
 * failure does (see grounded-marker-checker.js). deriveAuthStatePath() below
 * derives a per-environment-scoped path from whatever base path a consuming
 * repo already configures, so switching environments naturally uses (or
 * creates) a distinct stored state rather than reusing a stale one from a
 * different origin.
 *
 * Convention: plain functions over plain data, matching this package's
 * existing modules (ac-decision-loop.js, delegation-contract.js,
 * req-batcher.js) — strict validation, no silent defaulting.
