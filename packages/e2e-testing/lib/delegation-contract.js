/**
 * TRD-008/TRD-040: orchestrator <-> @playwright-tester delegation contract
 * for /ensemble:author-playwright-tests.
 *
 * Plain data shapes (no class hierarchy, no schema library) describing what
 * the author-playwright-tests session's orchestrating agent sends when it
 * delegates work for one AC to @playwright-tester, and what @playwright-tester
 * must send back.
 *
 * TRD-040 (found while adding a pre-run plain-English test preview): a single
 * combined "ground, author, and run" delegation gives the orchestrator no
 * seam to insert a QA-engineer confirmation between authoring and execution
 * — a subagent invoked via Task runs to completion in one shot; it can't
 * pause mid-call for a human answer the way the orchestrator's own
 * conversation can. So this contract is now TWO stages, each its own
 * request/response pair, with the QA engineer's accept/request-changes/reject
 * decision (ac-decision-loop.js) sitting between them:
 *   1. Proposal — ground the AC in code and author a test, but do not run it.
 *      Returns a plain-English summary of what the authored test actually
 *      does, for the orchestrator to present before ever spending a real run
 *      against the QA environment on a test the QA engineer hasn't seen yet.
 *   2. Run — execute the QA-engineer-confirmed test exactly as authored.
 * Each stage is a fresh, stateless subagent invocation (no memory of the
 * other stage), so the Run stage's request repeats whatever context it needs
 * (acText, groundingDiff) rather than assuming continuity with the Proposal
 * call — this also matches this package's existing "no injectable state
 * across calls" convention (ac-decision-loop.js, req-batcher.js).
 *
 * Implementation AC (TRD-008/TRD-040): given a proposal request (AC text,
 * grounding diff), @playwright-tester's response includes a proposed test,
 * selectors used, and a plain-English summary, or an explicit
 * authoring-failure flag — never silently omitted. Given a run request (the
 * confirmed test, target env, mode), the response includes a pass/fail run
 * result — never omitted.
 *
 * Follows this package's existing convention (pr-state.js,
 * implementation-grounding.js, resume-scan.js, prd-ac-parser.js): plain
 * exported functions over plain objects, no external validation library.

 *   the AC it exercises — grounded in the real test just written, not a bare
 *   restatement of the AC text — presented to the QA engineer before the
 *   test ever runs against the QA environment
 * (or an AuthoringFailure, when a test could not be authored at all)
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Object} RunRequest
 * @property {string} acText - repeated from the Proposal stage (TRD-040: each
 *   stage is a fresh, stateless subagent invocation) so @playwright-tester
 *   has AC context if it needs to investigate a failure
 * @property {*} groundingDiff - repeated from the Proposal stage; TRD-035's
 *   environment-mismatch marker extraction needs the diff at run time
 * @property {string} proposedTest - the exact, QA-engineer-confirmed test
 *   source to execute verbatim — never re-authored at this stage
 * @property {string} targetEnv - QA environment base URL/identifier to run the test against
 * @property {'headed'|'headless'} mode - session-wide execution mode chosen at session start
 *   (TRD-007) — controls ONLY whether a human is watching, never the auth strategy (TRD-037)
 * @property {string} [authStatePath] - TRD-036/TRD-037: the environment-scoped auth-state path
 *   (test-runner-mode.js's deriveAuthStatePath() output), used regardless of mode when the
 *   consuming repo has one — many real harnesses reuse one stored auth state for every run,
 *   headed or headless alike; optional, since not every target needs one (headed can still fall
 *   back to a live interactive login when omitted; headless has no such fallback)

 *   indistinguishable from a real regression otherwise).
