/**
 * TRD-004: implementation-grounding lookup for /ensemble:author-playwright-tests.
 *
 * Given a REQ-NNN and a TRD path, resolves the real code that satisfies that
 * REQ so a later interactive session can ground a proposed Playwright test in
 * the actual implementing diff rather than PRD prose alone:
 *
 *   1. Parse the TRD (via ./trd-task-parser.js, in-process) to get `tasksById`.
 *   2. Find the task(s) whose `satisfies` includes the REQ.
 *   3. For each task's `targetFiles`, get that file's git diff on the current
 *      branch vs. its merge-base with main/origin main.
 *
 * TRD-033: this originally shelled out to packages/development/lib/trd-cli.js
 * via a hardcoded `path.resolve(__dirname, '../../development/lib/trd-cli.js')`
 * — correct only in the monorepo checkout, where e2e-testing and development
 * are sibling directories under a shared packages/ root. Once installed as
 * real, independently-published Claude Code plugins, they land in separate
 * top-level plugin-cache directories; that relative path resolves to a
 * location that never exists, and grounding failed outright, for every REQ,
 * unconditionally, the moment the plugin was actually installed (confirmed
 * live against a real, open PR in the consuming application: ENOENT resolving trd-cli.js — found live-
 * dogfooding this feature, same as the merge-base/ADO-status bugs it sits
 * beside). No Claude Code plugin-dependency mechanism guarantees a stable,
 * version-independent filesystem path between two separately-versioned
 * plugin installs, so no cross-package path could be made to work reliably
 * post-install. Fixed by porting a small, scoped parser
 * (./trd-task-parser.js) into this package instead — the same "slimmed-down
 * sibling, not imported cross-package" pattern packages/e2e-testing/lib/
 * prd-ac-parser.js already established for the PRD-parsing equivalent of
 * this exact problem.
 *
 * Implementation AC (TRD-004): a REQ whose implementing files can't be
 * located never silently returns nothing and never throws — it reports an
 * explicit grounding gap instead. Every early-exit path below returns a
 * `{grounded: false, gap: true, reason}` result rather than throwing.
 *
 * Follows the injectable-exec convention from ./pr-state.js so the sibling
 * TRD-004-TEST task can stub git / TRD-parsing / file-system calls.
