/**
 * TRD-035: grounded-marker extraction for /ensemble:author-playwright-tests'
 * post-failure environment-mismatch triage (found live-dogfooding this
 * feature: a QA/staging environment can be reachable — HTTP check passes —
 * while still not be running the branch under test at all, e.g. a per-branch
 * or per-developer deploy slot that was never actually deployed with this
 * branch's code. That failure mode looks IDENTICAL to a real regression: the
 * test runs and fails on real assertions, and nothing points at "wrong
 * deploy" as a possible cause. Confirmed on a real, live PR before this
 * fix — a failing assertion cost real debugging time before the actual
 * cause (wrong environment, not a code defect) was found.
 *
 * This module answers one narrow question with a pure function: given the
 * diff a REQ/AC was grounded in, what are some concrete, checkable strings
 * that SHOULD be present on the live page if — and only if — that diff's
 * code is actually running there? Whether any of them actually show up is an
 * agent action at conversation time (Playwright: looking at the live,
 * rendered page), not something a pure function can determine — matching
 * ac-gap-detector.js's precedent for exactly this "pure extraction here,
 * live judgment there" split.
 *
 * Deliberately generic — no assumption about markup conventions, frameworks,
 * CSS methodologies, or naming schemes belonging to any one consuming repo
 * (this is NOT a CRIBs-specific fix; per-branch/per-developer deploy slots
 * are a common pattern anyone with more than one deploy target can hit).
 * Extracts from ADDED lines only (a diff's `+` lines, never `-`/context):
 *   1. Quoted string literals of a plausible marker length — covers class
 *      names, data-testid values, aria-labels, arbitrary attribute values,
 *      whatever a real diff happens to add.
 *   2. Individual whitespace-separated tokens within a multi-value quoted
 *      string (e.g. a `class="nav-icon-stack legacy-nav"` attribute) — a
 *      single-class change inside a longer class list is a common case, and
 *      only the changed token itself may reliably appear on the live page.
 *   3. Plain text between HTML/JSX tags (`>some text<`) — a lot of real UI
 *      changes are literal visible-text changes (a button label, a heading)
 *      that never appear inside quotes at all.
 * No AST, no framework-specific parsing. Over-extracting a few noisy
 * candidates is fine — the caller only needs ONE real hit to conclude "yes,
 * this code is live." Under-extracting the one marker that would have
 * proven it is the actual failure mode this module exists to avoid.
