/**
 * Capability resolution: require/optional-capability checking against a resolved adapter
 * manifest, cross-referenced with the declaring category contract (TRD-2026-8d825f54 TRD-013,
 * PRD REQ-004, AC-004-1, AC-004-2).
 *
 * `requireCapabilities(adapter, required, optional)` is the pre-flight check a caller runs
 * BEFORE invoking `runCapability` (`./runner.js`): it inspects the already-parsed, already-
 * validated adapter manifest's own `capabilities` map directly (no process is spawned, no
 * `runCapability` call is made) and:
 * - throws an `Error` with `error.code === 'UNAVAILABLE'` for the first entry in `required`
 *   that the adapter does not declare. The message names both the missing capability id and
 *   the adapter id (AC-004-1), so a caller never needs to re-derive which of several required
 *   capabilities failed.
 * - returns a per-capability result map for every entry in `optional`: `{available: true}`
 *   when the adapter declares it, or `{available: false, unavailable: true, fallback, message}`
 *   when it does not, where `fallback` is the `fallback` field from the capability's category
 *   contract entry (`packages/development/toolchain/categories/<category>.yaml`, loaded via
 *   `./contracts.js#loadContracts`) when the contract declares one, else `null` (AC-004-2).
 *
 * `lookupContractCapability(capabilityId, categoriesDir)` is the shared lookup both this
 * module and `./runner.js` use to find a capability's category-contract entry (description,
 * inputs, outputs, required, sideEffect, optional fallback) from a dotted `<category>.<name>`
 * id. `./runner.js#runCapability` calls it directly (not `requireCapabilities`) inside its own
 * `!cap` branch so a single, un-declared-but-optional-with-a-fallback capability returns an
 * `unavailable:true` envelope naming the documented fallback instead of a bare `NOT_ALLOWED`,
 * while every other `!cap` case (capability absent from the adapter AND either required or
 * declared nowhere in any contract) keeps returning the original `NOT_ALLOWED` envelope
 * byte-for-byte -- do not change that precedence here as a side effect of unrelated work.
 *
 * ## Known limits
 *
 * `requireCapabilities`'s `required` check only consults `adapter.capabilities`, never the
 * category contract's own `required: true/false` flag: the TRD's AC phrases "required" as
 * "the set of capability ids this feature needs", a caller-supplied list, not an inference from
 * the contract. A caller that wants only contract-mandatory capabilities enforced must build
 * that list itself (e.g. by filtering `loadContracts()` output for `required: true`); this
 * module does not do that inference, to avoid silently requiring capabilities the caller never
 * actually uses.
 *
 * `lookupContractCapability` re-reads and re-parses every `*.yaml` file in `categoriesDir` on
 * every call (via `loadContracts`, which does no caching) -- acceptable for this toolchain's
 * small (14-category) contract set and CLI-invocation lifetime, but a caller resolving many
 * capabilities in a hot loop should memoize `loadContracts()`'s result itself rather than
 * calling this function repeatedly; no caching is added here since none of the real callers in
 * this repo are a hot loop (preflight check, one-off CLI subcommand).
 *
 * ## Not yet reachable from a shipped entry point
 *
 * `requireCapabilities` has no production caller anywhere in this repo today (TRD review
 * Finding: an enforcement function with no caller enforces nothing). Command-level
 * `capabilities: {required, optional}` declarations on a command YAML, and the code that reads
 * one and calls this function before dispatching the command's body, arrive with TRD-022 (PR 5,
 * which depends on TRD-013, this file's own task). Do not invent a caller here or elsewhere in
 * this wave to make this function "used"; `./runner.js#runCapability` calling
 * `lookupContractCapability` directly (see that export's own doc above) is a different,
 * already-wired code path and does not substitute for `requireCapabilities` itself being
 * reachable.
