/**
 * Built-in `work-graph-links-fallback` adapter (TRD-027, br-jo8y; PRD REQ-016/AC-016-3,
 * REQ-020/AC-020-2/AC-020-3, REQ-004/AC-004-1/AC-004-2; TRD interpretation I7).
 *
 * Implements `work-graph.ready` and `work-graph.plan` for a tracker adapter whose own manifest
 * does not declare the `work-graph` category (`../work-graph-resolve.js#resolveWorkGraphAdapter`
 * is the only caller that selects this adapter, and only when the resolved tracker's manifest
 * `categories[]` omits `'work-graph'`).
 *
 * This file is a FLAT module directly under `lib/toolchain/builtin/` (not
 * `builtin/work-graph-links-fallback/index.js`) deliberately: `packages/pi`'s
 * `lib-bundler.ts` (the vendoring transform that ships this toolchain into the Pi/Codex
 * runtimes) resolves a relative require of a bare module specifier (no extension) by
 * appending `.js` to the SIBLING path -- it has no directory/`index.js` resolution step, so a nested
 * `builtin/work-graph-links-fallback/index.js` would silently vanish from both vendored
 * bundles (confirmed by direct experiment: `npm run generate:pi` logged `cannot read
 * .../builtin/work-graph-links-fallback.js: ENOENT` until this file moved here). Its
 * `adapter.yaml` lives under the sibling DATA directory,
 * `packages/development/toolchain/builtin/work-graph-links-fallback/adapter.yaml` (not inside
 * `lib/`), matching every other toolchain module's own established convention for non-`.js`
 * data (category contracts, schemas, `toolchain.default.yaml`) -- that whole directory is
 * vendored recursively, unlike `lib/`, which is vendored only via the require-closure walk.
 *
 * ## Execution design: in-process module, not a declarative subprocess adapter
 *
 * Every other adapter in this toolchain is "declarative": its manifest's `capabilities[].run[]`
 * argv template is substituted and spawned by `../runner.js#runCapability`. This adapter is
 * different by necessity -- its whole purpose is to COMPUTE a result from calls to a DIFFERENT
 * (tracker) adapter, which is not an argv template `runner.js` can express. Two designs were
 * considered:
 *   1. Add a small, generic "module capability" hook to `runner.js` itself (a new kind of
 *      `capabilities[]` entry, dispatched by `runCapability` to an in-process function instead
 *      of `execFile`).
 *   2. Keep `runner.js` untouched and have each of this fallback's few callers (the four
 *      `toolchain-cli.js` subcommand handlers that resolve `work-graph`, plus
 *      `../preflight.js#runPreflight`) detect "the resolved work-graph adapter is this builtin
 *      fallback" and call `runWorkGraphCapability` below directly instead of `runCapability`.
 * (2) was chosen: `runner.js` is a small, heavily-reviewed, heavily-tested module whose own
 * header documents an exact, audited envelope/error-code contract shared verbatim between its
 * async and sync entry points (`tests/toolchain-runner-sync-parity.test.js`) -- adding a second,
 * fundamentally different execution kind to it would widen that contract for a single caller.
 * The four CLI call sites and `runPreflight` already each resolve a category's adapter via their
 * own small, explicitly-duplicated block (`toolchain-cli.js`'s own documented convention, "a
 * deliberate, small duplication"), so adding one more conditional branch at each of those
 * existing resolution points is the smaller, more consistent change, and it keeps every other
 * adapter's execution path (including a tracker that genuinely implements `work-graph.*`
 * itself, e.g. `beads` via `bv`) completely unaffected.
 *
 * This module DOES still call `../runner.js#runCapability` -- twice, against the resolved
 * TRACKER adapter's own manifest (`tracker.list`, then `tracker.show` once per listed item) --
 * exactly as the TRD requires ("it calls tracker.list and tracker.show through the runner").
 * Only this fallback's OWN two capabilities bypass `runCapability`; the tracker calls it makes
 * use the real, unmodified runner execution/allowlist/timeout/error-taxonomy path.
 *
 * ## Dependency data shape
 *
 * A work item's dependency links are read from its (already runner-mapped) `tracker.show`
 * result's `dependencies` field, matching the existing normalized work-item schema
 * (`packages/development/toolchain/schemas/normalized/work-item.json`): an array of
 * `{id, type?}` objects. A bare array of id strings is also accepted for robustness, but the
 * canonical, already-documented shape a conforming tracker adapter's `tracker.show` `parse.map`
 * produces is the object form.
 *
 * ## Ordering source / dependency awareness
 *
 * After fetching every listed item's detail via `tracker.show`, this module checks whether ANY
 * fetched item carries a `dependencies` array at all:
 *  - if yes, `orderingSource: 'tracker-links'`, `dependencyAware: true` -- readiness and
 *    ordering are computed from the dependency graph (an item with no `dependencies` field of
 *    its own is treated as having none, i.e. vacuously ready).
 *  - if no (no fetched item's mapped `tracker.show` result carries `dependencies` at all --
 *    the tracker adapter simply does not expose this data), `orderingSource: 'plan-order'`,
 *    `dependencyAware: false` -- items are reported in the order `tracker.list` returned them,
 *    unfiltered by status (TRD Implementation AC 2: "items return in the supplied plan order").
 * Both capabilities' results carry `orderingSource`/`dependencyAware` (TRD: "Every result
 * carries orderingSource so commands print it" -- not just `work-graph.plan`, whose category
 * contract happens to be the one that names the field in its declared `outputs`).
